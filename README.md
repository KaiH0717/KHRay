# KHRay

This is a on-going project. The goal is to write a simple ray tracer that produces realistic images with unique effects.

# Features

- Ambient occlusion integrator
- Intel's embree3 library for accelerated ray tracing
- Multi-threaded rendering
- DXR-like acceleration structure (BLAS and TLAS)

# Goals

- Implement path tracing
- Implement spectral path tracing
- Implement importance sampling
- Implement multiple importance sampling
- Implement materials
- Implement various samplers

# Build

- Visual Studio 2019
- C++ 20

All of the required libraries should be included in the repository, the only thing needs to be done is to initialize the submodules

### Path integrator

#### Lambertian material (Buggy)

Buggy lambertian, thanks to Trolljanhorse#1596 from GP discord for helping me figure out the problem, the issue was that I wasnt clamping my lighting results before writing to png, I need to add proper tone mapping in the future.
